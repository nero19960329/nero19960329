### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Zhao Wang.

I am highly proficient in Python and have a solid understanding of C++ and Rust for programming. Currently, I am actively learning Go and TypeScript to expand my skillset.

I have conducted research on medical image processing using deep learning during my master's degree. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work in the QoS team at Hulu LLC., where I focused on improving service quality using machine learning techniques.

After completing my master's degree, I joined the AI-Computing team at Megvii Inc., where I am currently responsible for developing an AI compiler toolchain for edge computing. Additionally, I have gained valuable experience in developing cloud-based infrastructure for LLM applications.

I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Software Engineering at Tsinghua University.
