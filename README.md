### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hi, I'm Zhao Wang.

I am highly proficient in Python and have a solid understanding of C++ / Rust / Golang / TypeScript for programming.

I have conducted research on medical image processing using deep learning during my master's degree. Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to work in the QoS team at Hulu LLC.

After completing my master's degree, I joined the AI-Computing team at Megvii Inc., where I was responsible for developing an AI compiler toolchain for edge computing.

I completed both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Software Engineering at Tsinghua University.
